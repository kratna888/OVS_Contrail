3) Wondering if script does real time capture of alerts as it happens and sends out email?

The UVE stream provides the current operational state of the entities. Basically it would be keep pushing out updates of the entities. There are some filters you can apply for the objects that are of interest. For instance if you would like to get the updates on virtual network 

you can say 

http://10.87.28.178:9081/analytics/uve-stream?table-filt=virtual-netowrk

The IP - 10.87.28.178 is the analytic node IP.  Since MOS is using load-balancer the port number is 9081 otherwise it's 8081 

2) Do I run the script on all three controllers or this has to be run on only one contrail controller and

you can get the UVE-stream from analytic node .  If all the nodes ( config, analytic, db , control ) are in one server, you can use that server IP.  If they are running on different servers, you need to use the analytic node IP.


To get the alarm

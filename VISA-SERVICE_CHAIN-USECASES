1.MPLSoUDP - why can't we do VXLAN ? what is the limitation. 
  we do not comply to the VXLAN draft. We learn the MACs via XMPP
  VNF has two interfaces , one in red network and the other in green network. The one in green network is part of the service IPAM.
  For Service IPAM, we do not generate IPs. Kubernetes generate the IPs. So , how do we generate an IP for the green interface of the VNF.
  Hence VNF has to be a transparent mode
